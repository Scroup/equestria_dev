###------> Artillery   <><> <><> <><> <><> <><>
 artillery_a:0 "Refined Loading Mechanisms"
 artillery_a_desc:0 "Improved shell loading and ejection for all of our artillery pieces allow for a quick and seamless manual cycle that allows for continuous firing for our light and medium guns. Even the heavier pieces can output several shells a minute with this new loading system."
 artillery_c:0 "Streamlined Fire Coordination"
 artillery_c_desc:0 "When an artillery spotter is present, it is paramount that communication between the spotter and the responding battery is smooth and accurate. New language and terminology specifically designed to eliminate misunderstandings and to reduce the time between spotting and firing can be implemented, along with better radio integration between the spotter and gunner."
 artillery_d:0 "Grid Bearing Sighting"
 artillery_d_desc:0 "Resolving the azimuth of firing solutions was previously done by adjusting firing data based on the 'zero' of the orientated gun. By instead using the actual bearing to the target by grid bearing, we can reduce calculation errors ensure that the artillery battery is correctly laid."
 artillery_f:0 "Prism Paralleloscopes"
 artillery_f_desc:0 "An improvement over previous plain-mirror paralleloscopes, a prism improves the indirect firing capabilities by functioning as an aiming point in the horizontal plane during barrages. It is also particularly useful at night, as it does not require aiming points with lights attached to them."
#-<><><>
 rocket_artillery_a:0 "Additional Launch Rails"
 rocket_artillery_a_desc:0 "At times, a simple solution is the most effective one. The addition of more launch rails and racks increases the overall ordenance launched by a single rocket launcher carriage, promising more intensive barrages per launch."
 rocket_artillery_b:0 "Rocket Control Mechanisms"
 rocket_artillery_b_desc:0 "With the introduction of new control mechanisms for each rocket, such as self-stabilising fins, our rockets are far less likely to fly off course and instead shall hit their target more often."
# rocket_artillery_c:0 "X"
# rocket_artillery_c_desc:0 "X"
 rocket_artillery_d:0 "Specialised Rockets"
 rocket_artillery_d_desc:0 "Sometimes there is a circumstantial need for greater or lower area-of-effect on the battlefield, and a 'universal' rocket will not be as effective. Smaller and more numerous rockets can expand the area of fire whereas larger, more sophisticated ammunition can be more discriminate to tighten the bombardment zones."
 rocket_artillery_e:0 "High Octane Rocket Fuel"
 rocket_artillery_e_desc:0 "Elsewhere, our technical experience in both ballistic missile and rocket technology has introduced new specially-prepared rocket fuel that is incredibly high octane that improves on the flight characteristics of our ammunitions."
#-<><><>
 antiair_a:0 "Ballistic Computers"
 antiair_a_desc:0 "With the rise of jet aircraft, trajectory calculations by gunners are too slow for our anti-air guns to be effective. Integrating rudimentary computerised ballistic calculators, we can more correctly track and down fast enemy aircraft."
 antiair_b:0 "Gun Laying Radar"
 antiair_b_desc:0 "Miniaturisation of radar systems allow for individual guns to use their own radar domes or dishes to better detect and track aircaft, eliminiating the need of a more extensive and expensive radar relay that which would have previously coordinated with dozens of guns."
# antiair_c:0 "X"
# antiair_c_desc:0 "X"
 antiair_d:0 "Autoloaders"
 antiair_d_desc:0 "To maintain the competitive edge of our anti-aircraft guns, larger rounds are required, which interfere with the sustained rate of fire of lower calibres. Introducing mechanical autoloaders, AA gun crews can more readily maintain similar rates of fire of prior calibres while throwing heavier ordinance skywards."
 antiair_e:0 "Analogue Directors"
 antiair_e_desc:0 "Though somewhat impractical for smaller gun carriages, a dedicated electronic auxiliary predictor capable of quick trigonometric firing solutions drastically improve the efficacy of our heavier anti-aircraft guns, as jetcraft continues to break new speed records. It is thanks to these cumbersome directors that our conventional AA is still relevant in this new age."
#-<><><>
 antitank_a:0 "Plastic Explosive Ammunition"
 antitank_a_desc:0 "The introduction of High-Explosive Squash Head (HESH) or High-Explosive Plastic (HEP) ammunition was somewhat overshadowed by HEAT. However, refinements in the plastic explosive have made HESH and HEP rounds deadly due to improved spalling properties."
 antitank_b:0 "Fin-Stabilised Ammunition"
 antitank_b_desc:0 "With the simple addition of fin stabilisers to the core of our anti-tank rounds, our anti-tank rounds will lose far less speed when travelling to their intended targets, reducing dispersion as well as increasing their penetrative capacity."
# antitank_c:0 "X"
# antitank_c_desc:0 "X"
 antitank_d:0 "High-Low Pessure System"
 antitank_d_desc:0 "Utilising the pressure differential between the high pressure gases of ignition and the low pressure of the chamber, we can drastically cut down on equipment and ammunition weight while maintaining the same ballistics as those of a conventional design. This will enable massive upscaling of the calibre of our ammunition, further improving our dedicated anti-tank batteries."
 antitank_e:0 "Nightvision Integration"
 antitank_e_desc:0 "Improvements in nightvision technologies have eased the integration of these devices on our weapon platforms, significantly improving the efficacy of our anti-tank guns in low-light conditions. In many circumstances, our gunners will be able to hit a fast moving vehicle in the dead of night!"


###------> Infantry   <><> <><> <><> <><> <><>
 infantry_at_a:0 "Infantry Anti-Tank III"
 infantry_at_a_desc:0 "Out of every possible means of delivering ordinance against armoured targets, rocket-based weapons have shown to be the most effective. Arming our soldiers with these anti-tank rockets will make them a deadly foe to enemy armour."
 infantry_at_b:0 "Infantry Anti-Tank IV"
 infantry_at_b_desc:0 "Refinements of our anti-tank rocket launchers have crystallised to the recoilless platforms that are lightweight, can be shouldered, and provide the greatest caliber of ordinance against enemy targets. There is nothing more terrifying to a tanker than a soldier lying in wait with such a weapon."
#-<><><>
 advanced_infantry_weapons_a:0 "Improved Infantry Equipment IV"
 advanced_infantry_weapons_a_desc:0 "New efforts in standardisations for personal kits will allow us to focus on only certain firearms for further design improvements such as select-fire for assault rifles and better handling to make our soldiers even deadlier."
 advanced_infantry_weapons_c:0 "Improved Infantry Equipment V"
 advanced_infantry_weapons_c_desc:0 "With newer light-weight weaponry introduced with more modern weapons, soldier kits can allow for other equipment such as MREs, additional grenades or ammunition, all of which lengthens the staying power of our soldiers before they must withdraw."
 advanced_infantry_weapons_d:0 "Improved Infantry Equipment VI"
 advanced_infantry_weapons_d_desc:0 "A new generation of modern firearms may just be beyond the horizon, but that doesn't mean that further refinements of our current generation cannot be made. New modular designs improve ease of maintenance, all in service to making the lone soldier capable of fighting for as long as possible without support."
#-<><><>
 paratroopers_a:0 "Paratroopers IV"
 paratroopers_a_desc:0 "Special transport plane modifications that enable our troops to repel and exit from their transports more quickly will allow for smoother operations in harsh conditions."
 paratroopers_b:0 "Paratroopers V"
 paratroopers_b_desc:0 "Compact weaponry and lightweight equipment increases the mobility of our paratrooper units, allowing them to carry more gear when a specialized mission demands it."
 paratroopers_c:0 "Paratroopers VI"
 paratroopers_c_desc:0 "Further training enhancements designed to help our air assault units during night-time operations will make these missions more viable and lower the risk associated with them."
#-<><><>
 marines_a:0 "Marines IV"
 marines_a_desc:0 "Unconventional stealth and hand-to-hand combat techniques, learned and honed by our forces during past conflicts, will be taught to our special forces to ensure that the knowledge is not lost."
 marines_b:0 "Marines V"
 marines_b_desc:0 "Night-time operations are becoming increasingly viable thanks to new technologies. Night vision scopes and goggles allow our marines to operate just as well in the dark as they do in the light."
 marines_c:0 "Marines VI"
 marines_c_desc:0 "Amphibious operations are a mess of difficult environmental, physical, and psychological challenges that put to doubt the resolve of even the most seasoned soldier. Our only hope for our marines is to remove this hesitation to the point where they'd gladly charge against these obstacles and to overcome them every time."
#-<><><>
 mountaineers_a:0 "Mountain Infantry IV"
 mountaineers_a_desc:0 "It is often times simply not enough to train our specialised mountaineers to survive in their designated combat zones. We must instil into these hardened soldiers a fighting will so ardent and so stubborn, that even the mountains upon which they fight in would find difficult to break."
 mountaineers_b:0 "Mountain Infantry V"
 mountaineers_b_desc:0 "While our troops have been trained to survive and thrive in arduous conditions, their weapons must also be handle sub-zero temperatures. Making special weapon variants for our mountaineers may prove beneficial."
 mountaineers_c:0 "Mountain Infantry VI"
 mountaineers_c_desc:0 "Helicopters capable of being used in high altitudes and vehicles that can traverse treacherous mountain terrain are key to making sure that our mountaineering units are as mobile and advanced as possible."
#-<><><>
 support_weapons_a:0 "Support Weapons V"
 support_weapons_a_desc:0 "Despite some notable drawbacks and ethical questions, infantry flamethrowers can be highly effective provided they are used in the correct environment and circumstances."
 support_weapons_b:0 "Support Weapons VI"
 support_weapons_b_desc:0 "Lightweight, anti-personnel mines can be deployed more easily over a larger area compared to conventional anti-tank mines, for protecting FOBs and setting up ambushes."
 support_weapons_c:0 "Support Weapons VII"
 support_weapons_c_desc:0 "Specialized grenades, including incendiary, smoke, and tear gas variants, are normally only used by special forces. Outfitting our standard infantry units with these grenades may give our soldiers a tactical advantage in certain scenarios."
 support_weapons_d:0 "Support Weapons VIII"
 support_weapons_d_desc:0 "It is time to update our light and heavy machine guns, as new techniques and technologies have become available that can be used to produce more effective heavy weaponry."
 support_weapons_e:0 "Support Weapons IX"
 support_weapons_e_desc:0 "Making internal improvements to our support weapons will help to increase their lifespan by reducing wear and tear, allowing them to fire for longer with a barrel replacement."
 support_weapons_f:0 "Support Weapons X"
support_weapons_f_desc:0 "Trials done with newly developed anti-personnel mines have shown them to be more effective than the current models, with a smaller signature and larger blast radius."
