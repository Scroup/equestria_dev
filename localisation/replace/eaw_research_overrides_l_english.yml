 excavation_tech:0 "Excavation Technologies Research Speed"

 fuel_silos:0 "Organised Fuel Storage"
 fuel_silos_desc:0 "As liquid fuels become ever more commonplace and their storage grows, facilities dedicated to safeguard the resource become necessary. Silos and tanks to contain the fuel, pipes to allow easy access and transfer, and valves to secure it. These storage facilities are designed with potential expansion in mind should we need to increase our reserves."

 synth_oil_experiments:0 "Synthetic Material Experiments"
 synth_oil_experiments_desc:0 "As the world industrialises, the demand for valuable resources outpaces their natural supply. Synthesisation of oil and rubber show promise, with synthetic hydrocarbon oils and isoprene respectively being prime candidates in this effort."

 oil_processing:0 "Initial Hydrocarbon Oils"
 oil_processing_desc:0 "A somewhat poor alternative to conventional petroleum, hydrocarbon oils are based on organic compounds consisting entirely of hydrogen and carbon. Certain alkanes make for a suitable combustible fuel source that can supplement other more efficient fuels."
 improved_oil_processing:0 "Exploration of Hydrocarbons"
 improved_oil_processing_desc:0 "Growing fuel demands necessitate additional use of all of our fuels, including hydrocarbon oils. More streamlined extraction and storage methods for these will help meet the demand, even though petroleum is still a premium fuel source."
 advanced_oil_processing:0 "New Hydrogenation Processes"
 advanced_oil_processing_desc:0 "A developmental breakthrough in hydrogenation has made possible the production of a synthetic oil from coal dust. With copious amount of coal, this new synthetic oil may prove to be just as plentiful, if not more, than petroleum."
 modern_oil_processing:0 "Liquid Hydrocarbons"
 modern_oil_processing_desc:1 "Converting a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen to liquid hydrocarbons greatly expand the possibilities for alternative fuel sources. Though still somewhat less efficient than regular fuel, liquid hydrocarbon is just as viable due to the ease of storage compared to other hydrocarbon fuels."

 rubber_processing:0 "Semi-Synthetic Rubber Processing"
 rubber_processing_desc:1 "We know that heating isoprene with hydrochloric acid produces a rubber-like polymer. Though isoprene can only be obtained from distilling natural rubber, this process allows for an increased output from regular distillation and vulcanisation of rubber if we invest in it."
 improved_rubber_processing:0 "Initial Synthetic Rubber Processing"
 improved_rubber_processing_desc:1 "With the discovery of turpentine cracking, we can obtain isoprene without relying on natural rubber, though the process takes several weeks before ready to be turned into the rubber-like polymer."
 advanced_rubber_processing:0 "Sodium-based Polymerisation"
 advanced_rubber_processing_desc:1 "The polymerisation of isoprene can be sped up considerably with the use of sodium. Needless to say, this process will greatly increase output of artificial rubber."
 modern_rubber_processing:0 "Butadiene-based Polymerisation"
 modern_rubber_processing_desc:1 "Previous iterations of synthetic rubber have always been inferior to distilled natural rubber, making them less reliable. Polybutadiene, a butadiene polymer, is significantly more durable than natural rubber, effectively increasing our rubber production."

 fuel_refining:0 "Systemised Naphtha Refineries"
 fuel_refining_desc:0 "Previously, 'stills' could be used to separate the constituents of crude oil and condense the resultant vapours into liquid fractions, primarily kerosene and 'straight run' naphtha. There has been a scramble to produce the necessary naphtha with the invention of the internal combustion engine, leading to erratic and disorganised refining facilities. By organising the refineries with considerations made for all aspects, overall fuel production will improve and grow more efficient."
 fuel_refining2:0 "Improved Thermal Cracking"
 fuel_refining2_desc:0 "Automotive fuel is beginning to outstrip the market requirements for naphtha and kerosene. Thus, we must convert to light fuels such as gasoline. Previously a fraction byproduct from thermal cracking, we can improve distillation methods to favour greater yields of the more valuable gasoline instead of kerosene or naphtha."
 fuel_refining3:0 "Advancements in Naphtha Catalysation"
 fuel_refining3_desc:0 "A byproduct of a typical atmospheric distillation of crude oil is 'heavy' naphtha, which catalysed into a reformate essential for the gasoline blend. Advancements in this process vastly improve the gasoline blending pool's capacity and increase fuel production."
 fuel_refining4:0 "Reclaiming Coker and FCC Gas Oil"
 fuel_refining4_desc:0 "The process of producing coker naphtha and fluid catalytic cracker (FCC) gasoline creates gas oil as a wasted byproduct, typically unused in producing fuel. We've discovered that we can make fuel oil by using both the coker and the FCC with the gas oil. This 'heavy' fuel is excellent for marine engines and provides our maritime vessels with a supplement of fuel that doesn't cut into our general fuel reserves."
 fuel_refining5:0 "Supplemental Diesel Production"
 fuel_refining5_desc:0 "We've been creating diesel oil as a side product of our atmospheric distillation and hydrocracking for some time. Though it is louder, 'dirtier', and requires a different ignition process in engines from gasoline, diesel is more efficient. We might not entirely shift over to diesel, but not exploiting this other fuel source would be foolish, as we can produce more fuel overall with it."

 artillery3:0 "Muzzle Brakes"
 artillery3_desc:0 "To cut down on barrel length and weight, venting devices such as muzzle brakes and recoil compensators reduce the area needed to take up the strokes of recoil and kickback."
 artillery4:0 "Dismantlable Artillery"
 artillery5:0 "Low Silhouetted Artillery"
 artillery5_desc:0 "Artillery designs with lower silhouettes better hide the piece and will allow the guns to fire for longer before being spotted."

 rocket_artillery2_desc:0 "Self-propelled artillery utilizing multiple rockets will be able to cause large-scale destruction rapidly, while maintaining mobility to avoid counter-fire."
