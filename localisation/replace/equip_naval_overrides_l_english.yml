 battleship_4:0 "1015 Battleship"
 battleship_4_desc:0 "As the world sees what may be the last major battleship confrontations, the importance of heavy armaments and anti-air turrets is greater than ever."

 carrier_1:0 "Early Carrier"
 carrier_1_desc:0 "Many military theorists believe that naval aviation is the future. Converting old capital ships and ocean liners to carry aircraft will be the first step towards utilizing these new doctrines."
 carrier_2:0 "1007 Carrier"

 carrier_3_desc:0 "Improved construction methods and more specialized systems like deck edge elevators allow these carriers to transport more planes more efficiently."
 carrier_4:0 "1015 Carrier"
 carrier_4_desc:0 "With many naval treaties now increasingly ignored, we can proceed to build carriers capable of transporting more planes than ever to secure air superiority cover."

 SH_battleship_1:0 "1007 Super-Heavy Battleship"
 SH_battleship_1_desc:0 "We can focus entirely on creating the heaviest, most well-armed battleships of all time, able to engage multiple lesser vessels."
 SH_battleship_2:0 "1015 Super-Heavy Battleship"
 SH_battleship_2_desc:0 "An improvement on our earlier super heavy design with stronger weapons and improved fire control systems."

 ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff:0 "Pocket Battleship" 
 ship_hull_cruiser_panzerschiff_desc:0 "In an attempt to do the impossible, engineers succeeded in mating battleship-level armament with a cruiser hull. The result is a ship that outguns any other known cruiser, but which is also expensive, comparatively slow and relatively poorly armored."
 ship_hull_cruiser_coastal_defense_ship_desc:1 "An older design decades past, coastal defense ships combine the guns of a battleship with the hull of a cruiser, resulting in a powerful, but slow, cruiser, aimed at deterrence and local defense."
 ship_hull_cruiser_submarine_desc:0 "These larger submarines can patrol a longer range and hold more firepower or support equipment than their smaller cousins. However, their vulnerability and expense is making them obsolete."

 ship_heavy_battery_1_desc:0 "A large-caliber cannon dating from before the fall of the Griffonian Empire."
