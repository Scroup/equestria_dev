 STGVAS_amnesty_for_monarchists:0 "Amnesty for Monarchists"
 STGVAS_amnesty_for_monarchists_desc:0 "The various dissident factions in Severyana could prove to be useful.

 military_factories_in_STG_desc:0 "Many factories in Stalliongrad have been dedicated solely to producting tractors for the farmers, but with the collectivisation completed and our requirements satisfied, they're a prime target for a renovation into proper military-industrial complexes to produce any kind of firearms we require."
 industrialize_the_north:0 "Northern Industrial Effort"

 STGVAS_konzan_research_facility:0 "Konzan Research Facility"

 STGVAS_day_of_knowledge_desc:0 "While very few foals are excited about leaving their Summer vacation and going back to school, perhaps we can change this by having the first day of classes be seen as a time of joy.

 STGVAS_nimbusikiada:0 "Nimbusikiada"

 STGVAS_streamlined_light_tanks_desc:0 "We've learned how to efficiently produce our light tank models, and now less resources get wasted during production. We can expect our reserves to steadily grow, which is invaluable in times of war."
 ### VERONICA ###
 STGVAS_medium_tanks:0 "Veronica's Mainstay of the Army"
 STGVAS_medium_tanks_desc:0 "Medium tanks: reliable, effective, good balance of firepower, armour and mobility. We shall put our efforts in ensuring they are widely used, easily produced and have extensive support on the battlefield. We can see it now already: a vast column of Severyan tanks rolling across countrysides and parade grounds."
 STGVAS_mechanization:0 "Plans for Mechanisation"
 STGVAS_mechanization_desc:0 "As war becomes more deadlier, our existing motorised vehicles are becoming insufficient in terms of protection and firepower. Designs have been drawn up to start adding armour and turrets on our vehicles. They won't be a replacement for a proper tank, but our troops will certainly appreciate the added degree of protection while redeploying."
 STGVAS_cheaper_mot:0 "Motorisation of the Army"
 STGVAS_cheaper_mot_desc:0 "To ensure our army can become fully adapted to the requirements of mobile warfare, we must look into cutting down on production costs for our trucks and similar vehicles, so that we can have an ample supply for our needs."
 STGVAS_cheaper_medium_tank:0 "Cost Cutting Measures"
 STGVAS_cheaper_medium_tank_desc:0 "The truth is that despite our efforts in increasing our strategic material production, we simply can't spare enough for the production of our new tanks. We shall look into cutting some of the excess features on these tanks to keep the costs down. Quantity will be the quality."
 STGVAS_composite_armoured_medium_tank:0 "Composite Armour Experiments"
 STGVAS_composite_armoured_medium_tank_desc:0 "By combining several plates of armour, we can make our armoured vehicles more durable. Production costs will undoubtedly rise from the increased quality, but it will be more than worthwhile as our enemy will find himself unable to breach their armour."
 STGVAS_blitzkrieg_veronica:0 "Napadajushchie Manevri"
 STGVAS_blitzkrieg_veronica_desc:0 "A motorised army requires a different way of thinking compared to the strategies of past wars. We must ensure they stay organised and coordinated in the face of any threat."
 STGVAS_firepower_veronica:0 "Snaryadi i Puli"

 STGVAS_operational_integrity:0 "Keeping the Skies Clear"
 STGVAS_operational_integrity_desc:0 "Our mobile army can't operate effectively if cannot secure the control of the skies. Our pilots will be trained to focus on air superiority first and foremost."
 STGVAS_medium_tanks2:0 "T-34 Improvements"
 STGVAS_medium_tanks2_desc:0 "While our tank models are currently satisfactory in terms of firepower and durability, we can always look into improving their performance further. We'll get those designers drawing up new plans immediately!"
 STGVAS_army_on_wheels:0 "Mobile Army"
 STGVAS_army_on_wheels_desc:0 "Our transition to a contemporary mobile army has been a great success. With just a few more improvements, we shall stay at the top in terms of strategy and doctrine."

 STGVAS_kostylev_ponyarchuk_desc:0 "Comrades Ponyarchuk and Kostylev believe in a more traditional style of warfare, with the gallant spirit of infantry leading the way. Modern weaponry will be utilised where appropriate, but our focus will be on fielding a large infantry army."
 ## KOSTYLEV ###
 STGVAS_full_infantry_army:0 "Kostylev's Traditional Army"
 STGVAS_full_infantry_army_desc:0 "The old method of warfare is still applicable today - massed infantry charges supported by artillery barrages. Meanwhile, our skilled commanders draw up extensive plans and help coordinate assaults. This is the doctrine Severyana will pursue."
 STGVAS_grand_battleplan:0 "A Plan for Every Occassion"
 STGVAS_grand_battleplan_desc:0 "Wars are not won purely by fighting, but with extensive preparation and planning. While battleplans rarely survive first contact with the enemy, we can attempt to mitigate the worst, and by doing so, make the lives of our soldiers much easier."
 STGVAS_sup_fire_power:0 "Storm of Bullets"
 STGVAS_sup_fire_power_desc:0 "Only one way leads to victory - having more firepower than the enemy. More guns, more shells, more bombs, this is what we need to secure the dominance of our armies."
 STGVAS_arty_research:0 "Modernisation of Artillery"
 STGVAS_arty_research_desc:0 "While our current artillery pieces are satisfactory in terms of performance, reliability and firepower, they're still barely modified versions of the models left behind by Equestrians from the last decade. We must come up with our own design, a much more efficient one."
 STGVAS_aquileia_exp_share:0 "Aquileia Experience"
 STGVAS_aquileia_exp_share_desc:0 "The griffons of Aquileia have seen a fair share of war in recent times. Now that a potentially friendly government is in charge, we should approach them to learn from their military experience."
 STGVAS_earthpony_entrenchment:0 "Recruit Earthpony Sappers"
 STGVAS_earthpony_entrenchment_desc:0 "Unicorns are capable of many things with their magic, but it takes a particularly powerful and skilled mage to achieve what we need on the battlefield. Thus, we turn to the reliable earth pony, who can work hard and smart digging trenches, constructing makeshift bridges and so on."
 STGVAS_planning_expertise:0 "Planning Schools"
 STGVAS_planning_expertise_desc:0 "The troops are courageous and skilled, no doubt, but they require capable leaders, as well. Our officer academy programs will be expanded to include a vast set of tactics and strategies, anything that can help out our commanders formulate an efficient plan for any given situation."
 STGVAS_air_infantry_grind:0 "Reinforcements from the Skies"
 STGVAS_air_infantry_grind_desc:0 "To compliment our ground forces, our pilots will be trained to perform in a way that most effectively supports them. This of course, includes designing new variants for this mission."
 STGVAS_engineer_bonus:0 "Sapper Companies"
 STGVAS_engineer_bonus_desc:0 "Now that we've recruited a sufficient amount of earth ponies for our engineer companies, it is time to assemble them as proper support batallions so that they can assist our forces on the field."
 STGVAS_professional_infantry:0 "Professional Infantry"
 STGVAS_professional_infantry_desc:0 "We've achieved perfect coordination between the multiple branches of the army, and now we can reap the benefits. The Severyan pony is proud to serve, knowing that each and every soldier is professionally trained."
 ## PONYARCHUK ##
 STGVAS_mass_assault:0 "Ponyarchuk's Red Wave"
 STGVAS_mass_assault_desc:0 "Comrade Ponyarchuk thinks we should dispense with the pleasantries and complex strategems and simply overwhelm our foes in one glorious charge by our infantry! To achieve this, we need two things: many soldiers and the best rifles."
 STGVAS_mass_assault_yes:0 "Pony Wave Tactics"
 STGVAS_mass_assault_yes_desc:0 "The ponies will need a different method of training to accomodate to our doctrine. We can't let them wander aimlessly, they need to strike with precision!"
 STGVAS_cheaper_weapons:0 "Cheaper Weapons"
 STGVAS_cheaper_weapons_desc:0 "Currently, a decent stockpile of infantry weapons exists, but once the recruitment drives begin and our forces start growing, we'll be having a critical lack of firearms. To prevent the occasion that a pony won't be having his own gun, we'll optimise our method of producing rifles. Can't let anything go to waste."
 STGVAS_infantry_tanks:0 "Heavily Armoured Assistance"
 STGVAS_infantry_tanks_desc:0 "We're not blind, infantry alone cannot win battles. Which is why we're designing an extremely sturdy tank, able to withstand a direct hit from smaller artillery pieces. They will smash a hole where our enemies' defences are the strongest, so our forces can breach and flood the area." 
 STGVAS_burn_them_with_bombers:0 "Tactical Bomber Support"
 STGVAS_burn_them_with_bombers_desc:0 "In addition, our troops require support from the skies to remove particularly troublesome fortifications. Our bomber pilots will be trained in new methods to most effectively use their payload."
 STGVAS_expanded_conscription:0 "Expanded Conscription"
 STGVAS_expanded_conscription_desc:0 "It is not enough, we simply need more ponies to serve in our armed forces. Expand the conscription, promote more recruitment drives, introduce more benefits to soldiers - they must join!"
 STGVAS_giant_army:0 "Nasha Velikaya Armiya"
 STGVAS_giant_army_desc:0 "Our goal has been completed. We have so many soldiers, the ground shakes during their marches! The next military parade in Stalliongrad will be the grandest one yet! While our commander struggle leading such vast numbers, it is only a temporary problem. We shall prevail!"
 
 ### AIR FORCE ###
 STGVAS_proletarian_air_fleet:0 "The Proletarian Air Fleet"
 STGVAS_proletarian_air_fleet_desc:0 "Look to the skies, ponies! The future lies in making the most out of aircraft and its related technologies. Not only will civilian travel be greatly improved, but we'll gain a decisive edge in war by focusing on airplanes. To help us in this goal, two competing companies are offering their designs and plans."
 STGVAS_air_defence_stalliongrad:0 "Air Defence of Stalliongrad"
 STGVAS_air_defence_stalliongrad_desc:0 "The concentration of industry in Stalliongrad is both a boon and a curse. With bombers gaining in range and payload, an enemy could strike at our most important factories and dismantle our production for weeks and months. To counter this, an extensive array of anti-air batteries will be installed around our capital."
 STGVAS_air_defence_konzan:0 "Air Defence of Konzan"
 STGVAS_air_defence_konzan_desc:0 "Konzan contains some of our most important research facilities and it would be prudent to secure it with large caliber guns to protect it from any air strikes. Our secret projects must not be hindered."
 STGVAS_air_defence_petershoof:0 "Air Defence of St. Petershoof"
 STGVAS_air_defence_petershoof_desc:0 "Not only does St. Petershoof contain important industrial concerns, it is also our most important naval base. We cannot let the foe bomb our ships while they're docked for repairs."
 STGVAS_air_defence_borders:0 "Pre-emptive Defence"
 STGVAS_air_defence_borders_desc:0 "The key towards minimising damage inflicted is reacting to an attack as soon it is spotted. As such, we'd be wise to place anti-air batteries on our border regions."

As such, our pilots need to be in top physical condition, trained in our strategy and more. We shall also start a recruitment drive to attract more recruits for the air force."
 STGVAS_border_air_fields:0 "Border Air Bases"
 STGVAS_border_air_fields_desc:0 "Our aircraft needs to be spread out in order to effectively react to enemy air strikes and assaults. Building hangars on the borders will ensure that the threat is met as soon it shows up on the radar."

 stalliongrad_news.103.d:0 "Disaster has struck Stalliongrad. On the morning of March 17th, an explosion rocked the palace of the Grand Soviet, setting off a small fires and killing a number of council officials. An investigation is currently underway, but there is nothing that could lead to a culprit, and authorities are not confident of finding such evidence any time soon. Rumours are aplenty, ranging from Changeling sabotage to domestic terrorism. Whatever may be the case, it is clear that somepony’s not pleased with their current administration."

As our brave troops stormed Equestrian armouries and garrisons all over the country slaughtering any and all Equestrian soldiers found, the populace begun lynching any Equestrian officials they could find. All of this was spurred on by General Secretary Dark Wing whose voice could be heard on every radio station in Stalliongrad proclaiming not just the return of proper communism to Stalliongrad but to all of Equestria..."

 stalliongrad_news.105.d:0 "Needless to say today has seen an interesting turn of events, as the General Secretary of Stalliongrad or should we say, Supreme Leader Dark Wing proclaimed an end to both the Stalliongradian Politburo and Supreme Soviet. Those few that resisted the Supreme Leader's actions were swiftly dealt with by soldiers loyal to the regime, this act has effectively given Dark Wing absolute power over all of Stalliongrad's affairs. However all of that was overshadowed by the Supreme Leader's radio address to the nation in which he proclaimed the dissolution of Stalliongrad... and the proclamation of the Greater Equestrian Union."

stalliongrad_news.109.d:0 "After Dark Wing has been elected as the general secretary of Stalliongradian Republic, the country drifted to pro-Equestrian rhetoric. In several months, Severyana Republic became an autonomous state under Equestrian leadership. Now Equestrian and Stalliongradian officials have decided that the time has come to reunite Stalliongrad with Equestria. From this day Severyana as an independent or semi-independent nation ceases to exist."

stalliongrad_news.110.d:0 "In a textbook case of the Stalliongrad military doctrine the original breakaway nation from Equestria has deployed their military to the south and into the territory of the newly formed Lunar Empire. What positions Nightmare Moon’s military were able to hastily erect in the chaos of the ongoing civil war were quickly swept away, troops fleeing in their wake. Nightmare Moon was unable to be reached for comment, but Gensec [STG.GetLeader] was quoted as saying that the morning’s events were a natural consequence of Equestrian alicorncracy. Despite both sides saying that they did not wish to escalate the conflict at the current time it’s undoubtable that this will lead to conflicts in the future."

 stalliongrad.0.t:0 "Home of the Revolution"
 stalliongrad.0.d:0 "More than a decade ago, the great revolutionary named Steel Stallion sparked a revolt in the city of Stalliongrad, one of the poorest regions in Equestria. They dreamed of forming a country with a completely new economic and social system, where everypony is given equal opportunity, where everypony receives everything according to their needs. The revolt spread like wildfire and received support from the surrounding cities and villages. Equestrian officials were sent to quell the rebellion when the independence of the Republic of Stalliongrad was announced. The Equestrian army command could not tolerate it and, in several hours, the Equestrian Royal Army entered the territory of the young republic. The war continued for less than a week before Princess Celestia personally ordered her troops to stop their advance. Several generals were fired from their posts for their aggressive actions. With hopes of a brighter future, the determined ponies of Stalliongrad continue their struggle."

 stalliongrad.12.t:0 "The Time of Troubles"
 stalliongrad.12.d:0 "After more than a decade since the establishment of the Republic of Stalliongrad, the future of it has been covered in mist of disputes, political and social stagnation. Promises of better life are not becoming reality. However the masses are not discouraged yet and if we manage to choose the right path, reform the government, finish industrialisation and end the food shortage problem, we can rely on our people to support us in every move."
 stalliongrad.12.a:0 "Horosho."
 stalliongrad.13.t:0 "Party Disagreements"
 stalliongrad.13.d:0 "When the revolution succeeded, the Stalliongradian Communist Party took control of the state in their hooves. For most of that time, the highest positions in the party have been occupied by Altidiya Revoltsova and Vasiliy Pantsushenko, two earthponies, under whose leadership Stalliongrad began its transformation into a socialist state. During that time, two ponies envied each other more and more. Over time their leadership has turned into a competition of personal achievement. The party has split in two groups, each supporting the leader of their preference."
 stalliongrad.13.a:0 "It continues."
 stalliongrad.14.t:0 "The Construction of the Palace of the Soviets!"
 stalliongrad.14.d:0 "Our constructors have started clearing the ground in the city centre. The old pre-revolutionary apartment buildings are being demolished to make space for the new, monumental parliament building, the Palace of the Soviets. This will truly be our greatest architectural achievement. The world will know of the mighty hoof of the Stalliongradian workers!"
 stalliongrad.14.a:0 "Future awaits!"
 stalliongrad.2.t:0 "Different Outlook"
 stalliongrad.2.d:0 "In the latest private meeting of the party members, the main topic of discussion was the situation in the country. As always. The two leaders expressed different plans for the first steps to solving the issues that concern the citizens today. Altidiya suggested that Stalliongrad requires an expansion of the propaganda and educational campaigns in order to make more ponies class-aware and interested in politics, which, in the long run, will provide us with capable ministers and organisers. Vasiliy suggested that the state needs to relocate these resources on supporting the worker cooperatives in Stalliongrad. This path will lead to the industrialisation can be finished quicker."
 stalliongrad.2.a:0 "Propaganda broadcasts."
 stalliongrad.2.b:0 "Relocate money for industry."
 stalliongrad.15.t:0 "Internal Politics"
 stalliongrad.15.d:0 "Despite that both leaders have good points and a reasonable approach to running the state, it is obvious that Altidiya is currently an inspirational leader for the people and the pony capable of taking the future of Stalliongrad in her own hooves. Vasiliy, on the other hoof, had a good start, but instead slowed down to a full stop. We need to take measures against Vasiliy's impulses to seize power in the party and expel him, if necessary."
 stalliongrad.15.a:0 "Ladno."
 stalliongrad.16.t:0 "Internal Politics"
 stalliongrad.16.d:0 "Despite the fact that both leaders have good points and a reasonable approach to things in the state, Vasiliy has proven himself as a capable leader. The personal grudge between him and Altidiya, however, cannot continue any longer. We must find a compromise between the two leaders or, if there is enough support of the party members, promote Vasiliy as a new candidate for General Secretary and expel Altidiya from the party, if that is necessary."
 stalliongrad.16.a:0 "Posmotrim."
 stalliongrad.17.t:0 "Internal Politics"
 stalliongrad.17.d:0 "It is obvious that both leaders have good points and a reasonable approach, concerning the situation in the state. However the personal grudge is still tense between them. Recently, Vasiliy demanded a compromise from Altidiya, claiming that he has been doing a great job staying in power under her and that he wants to receive his due appreciation and the higher post of General Secretary of the Party, an equal to Altidiya herself. We need to decide whether we are going to support him or Altidiya."
 stalliongrad.17.a:0 "Can we have two general secretaries?"
 stalliongrad.18.t:0 "Internal Politics"
 stalliongrad.18.d:0 "It is obvious that both leaders have good points and a reasonable approach, concerning the situation in the state. However the personal grudge is still tense between them. Recently, Vasiliy demanded a compromise from Altidiya, claiming that he has been doing a great job staying in power under her and that he wants to receive his due appreciation and the higher post of General Secretary of the Party, an equal to Altidiya herself. We need to decide whether we are going to support him or Altidiya."
 stalliongrad.18.a:0 "Posmotrim."
 stalliongrad.19.t:0 "Altidiya's Focus"
 stalliongrad.19.d:0 "A summit took place in the Supreme Soviet today and, after a long debate, the assembly decided to demote Vasiliy from his post. His policies led to political and economic stagnation and desolation of the country. It is time for us to move forward and form a new government."
 stalliongrad.19.a:0 "Da."
 stalliongrad.20.t:0 "The New Government"
 stalliongrad.20.d:0 "The time has come for Vasiliy to step back and make way for the new ponies in government. Under cover of night, a group of ponies led by Altidiya seized the Supreme Soviet building. Vasiliy, Sinister, Nestor and other members of the party who supported the other side, in fear of reprisals, have crossed the border and fled to Equestria or the Crystal Empire. The new government, with Dark Wing as the head of state, was formed."
 stalliongrad.20.a:0 "K luchshemu buduschemu."
 stalliongrad.21.t:0 "Vasiliy's Frame of Mind"
 stalliongrad.21.d:0 "A summit took place in the Supreme Soviet today and, after hours of debates, the party members chose to support Vasiliy's candidacy on the post of General Secretary. The decision was made based on the votes of the soviet representatives. However, Altidiya and her supporters, such as General Ponyarchuk, refused to give way and step back from the high seat. According to the codex of the party, if, by the end of a debate, where the problem was resolved by a vote, if a member that shows disrespect for the opinion of majority and continues to pursue their own interest, they shall be expelled from the party. It is time for us to act!"
 stalliongrad.21.a:0 "Da!"
 stalliongrad.22.t:0 "Compromise"
 stalliongrad.22.d:0 "Luckily, nothing interrupted the soviet on this sunny [GetMonth] day. Tensions between the two party groups were peacefully talked over. The committee came to an agreement that the conflict should be resolved peacefully. The summits will continue until all the questions are discussed and a solution to all of them is found."
 stalliongrad.22.a:0 "Way to go."
 stalliongrad.23.t:0 "Party Elections!"
 stalliongrad.23.d:0 "Since all of the Altidiya's supporters have been expelled from the party, it is time to elect a new General Secretary. There were several candidates for that post, however, some of them refused to take the responsibility, that leaves us with two main candidates."
 stalliongrad.23.a:0 "Let's see."
 stalliongrad.24.t:0 "The Power of the Ponies"
 stalliongrad.24.d:0 "Arguments in the Supreme Soviet are rising in strength every day. As a more active and radical pony, Altidiya promotes change and openness of the state affairs to the public. Vasiliy argues that to prevent counter-revolution and promote stability, Stalliongrad should stick to the current government and wait for the right moment to act. They both suggest their own vision of the actions to take in the current situation."
 stalliongrad.24.a:0 "Jest."
 stalliongrad.25.t:0 "The Plans"
 stalliongrad.25.d:0 "The summit has been held in the Supreme Council today and Vasiliy suggested that Stalliongrad needs to focus on improving its infrastructure in order to create more workplaces and connect remote areas together. Altidiya offered her plan majoring on military industry in Stalliongrad itself, as the state needs to protect itself. It is up to the soviets to decide what plan are we going to follow."
 stalliongrad.25.a:0 "Tak."
 stalliongrad.26.t:0 "Pantsushenko's Crew"
 stalliongrad.26.d:0 "Altidiya's supporters have been expelled from the party and their occupations cleared. The elements Altidiya was about to bring into power were very suspicious. We can with confidence say that we've prevented counter-revolution and collapse of the Stalliongradian state. General Ponyarchuk, Kors Relux, Ivan, and Dark Wing are no longer a threat to us. All the old leaders remain in their posts, however, and are ready to continue their work on the path of reaching communism in Stalliongrad."
 stalliongrad.26.a:0 "Well deserved."
 stalliongrad.27.t:0 "Sinister Serov"
 stalliongrad.27.d:0 "Sinister Serov announced his intentions to participate in the elections. Earlier, he supported Vasiliy and was a part of the same coalition with him, but his different view on the solution of state problems made him take a separate stance in this elections. \n Sinnie's speech is demagogic and populist, he insists on toughening the role of the state in all spheres of society, but at the same time openly expresses his view on ineffectiveness of the collective farm system and the need to allow market elements in agriculture. The pony has imperialistic ambitions, justified by the struggle against plutocratic enemies, and calls to build up Stalliongrad's hegemony on the continent."
 stalliongrad.27.a:0 "Tak."
 stalliongrad.28.t:0 "Vasiliy"
 stalliongrad.28.d:0 "Vasiliy Pantsushenko was a prime minister after Altidiya whose political rhetoric is characterised by ultra-communist convictions. Vasiliy stands for preserving and toughening the "true-socialist way" of the state ideology and supports interventionist foreign policy. He has gained paranoia after years of work with Altidiya, that affects his political course in both foreign and internal spheres. He claims he struggles for "purity" of the communist ideas in the party and will to defend the achievements of revolution to an end."
 stalliongrad.28.a:0 "Tak."
 stalliongrad.29.t:0 "Dark Wing"
 stalliongrad.29.d:0 "Darkwing begins his election campaign with an appeal to the ponies of Stalliongrad. Speaking of his goals as the ruler of Stalliongrad, he calls himself loyal to Altidiya Revoltsova and her ideas. At the same time, Darkwing considers other party leaders to be corrupt and incompetent, and lays the blame of famine and the economic difficulties entirely on them. \n The politician saw the way out of the crisis in the rapprochement and cooperation with Equestria, first of all for the common good, in order to overcome hunger, and for mutual protection against the growing threat represented by changelings."
 stalliongrad.29.a:0 "Tak."

 stalliongrad.30.d:0 "We are gathered here today to elect a new General Secretary of the Stalliongradian Communist Party. The decisions of the general secretary are going to be most influential in the state's foreign and internal politics. We have two candidates to choose from."

 stalliongrad.34.t:0 "Urgent Elections"
 stalliongrad.34.d:0 "Altidiya has retired due to her poor health condition. She is no longer capable of managing the state on General Secretary post.

 stalliongrad.34.a:0 "Uvidim."
 stalliongrad.35.t:0 "Ten Conditions"
 stalliongrad.35.d:0 "[GetDate]. On today's summit it was decided to finally reconcile the two leaders. Listing his ten conditions to Altidiya, he demanded them all to be met by her. He exclaimed that if the head of state refuses them, Vasiliy is going to leave the party."

 stalliongrad.36.t:0 "Dark Wing seizes power"
 stalliongrad.36.d:0 "Under cover of night Dark Wing and his collaborators have set the Supreme Soviet building on fire. In the morning the blame for these actions was put on Vasiliy's supporters.

 stalliongrad.37.t:0 "Dark Wing"
 stalliongrad.37.d:0 "After Polya's retirement there are no ponies that we can turn to other than the second leader after her, Dark Wing. he calls himself loyal to Altidiya Coggydeer and her ideas. At the same time, Darkwing considers former party members to be corrupt and incompetent, he lays the blame of food problems and the economic difficulties entirely on them. \n Dark Wing sees the way out of the crisis in the rapprochement and cooperation with Equestria, first of all for the common good, in order to overcome hunger, and for mutual protection against the growing threat of changelings."
 stalliongrad.37.a:0 "Okay."
 stalliongrad.4000.t:0 "Landowners and petite bourgeoisie rebel!"

This is a great day when our ideology will finally reveal its true essence - the essence of the protector of all people and the civilisation itself.\n\nOur region has always been famous for the harsh, cold climate that caused our ancestors to suffer - but one day we tamed nature, we changed it, adapting it to our own needs. Remember the years of oppression under the deceitful Goddesses, when days and nights we worked for them, but there were no real social guarantees - only hypocritical dogmas about illusory Harmony. Remember what difficulties we encountered during the revolutionary war, and after it - when all the "civilised" nations in one moment exposed their plutocratic face, trying to destroy our righteous society by the most heinous methods. But we overcame these difficulties - we became strong and proud as never. And now, we full of determination to achieve new peak and conquer new fortresses.\n\nThis is a necessary war, it is a war that under no circumstances could be avoided.

Truly, there is taking place today a formidable struggle between two worlds. Never has the history seen a similar drama, a drama in which we are now among the great leading characters.\n\nThe task of the hour is one and only one: To fight, to fight all together. The comradeship between us becomes closer day by day, becomes a way of common life. We are similar enough and different enough to understand each other, to esteem each other mutually, to fuse together all our energies, since the cause is one. No longer can distinctions be made; our enemies do not make any.\n\nThe Equestrian plutocracy are conducting this war with one sole purpose: They want to reduce the globe to the state in which Buffalo State is today. They want all of people to work in order to give the Equestrian Bourgeoisie an another millennium of another name of exploitation - a "Harmony". They want a world of slaves in order to guarantee for the Сanterlot aristocracy their five daily digestions. They want to destroy Communism, and under this name they include all the movements such as include Starlight ideology that named as Equality...\n\nNow, comrades, we must fight for the living ones, fight for the future, but also for the dead. We must fight so that the sacrifice of our dead be not in vain, so that the sacrifice of those who fell in the revolutionary war.\n\nThey, the dead, imperiously command us to fight through till victory.

With you the entire world is witness that Communist Stalliongrad has done all that is possible to avoid the torment which is throwing our continent into turmoil; but all was in vain. It would have sufficed to revise the treaties to bring them up to date with the changing needs of the life of our nation and not consider them untouchable for eternity.\n\nBut now all of that belongs to the past. If now today we have decided to face the risks and the sacrifices of a war, it is because the honour, the interests, the future impose an iron necessity, since a great people is truly such if it considers sacred its own duties and not evade the supreme trials which change the course of history.\n\nWe take rifles in hooves to free the working people of all Equestria from exploitation and plutocracy, which in the minds of the masses is indestructible and endless.\n\nThis gigantic struggle is nothing other than a phase in the logical development of our revolution; it is the struggle of peoples that are poor but rich in workers against the exploiters who hold on ferociously to the monopoly off all the riches and all the gold of the world; it is the struggle between our century and two ideas.\n\nProletarian Stalliongrad stands up again, strong, proud, and united as never before. The single order of the day is categorical and obligatory for all. And this order is... Victory!

stalliongrad.132.d:0 "Comrades! The working people of Stalliongrad!\n\nWe face an enemy more terrible than bourgeois plutocracy. Monsters, whose motives are the same as those of an animal - endless hunger and bloodthirsty cruelty.\n\nThat is why today, our duty is not only to defend our motherland, but also bring the justice to this abomination by our sword.\n\nWithout the official declaration of war from the chitinous imperialists, their divisions have already entered our land. Now we must answer them with our steel determination.\n\nRemember who you are, proud Stalliongradians! We are a people who have thrown off the heavy chains of Equestrian exploitation. We have become a country of true democracy, freedom and order. Our technologies, our industry and our powerful weapons are famous all over the world. Knowing this, our cruel enemy intends to capture all our achievements. Bring it to yourself, just like a barbarian, as they really are.\n\nWe must show the true honour and courage of our people, trampling the invaders with the horseshoe straight into the swamps from which they all came. Our determination in the fight against the changeling swarm should be an example for every state in the world.\n\nAllow your rifle to carry the word about our righteous ideology through the counter strike to the abominable bug.\n\nThis is a sacred war; it is a war that under no circumstances could be failed. History always requires us to choose: life or death, freedom or slavery. Let the whole world see in our working people heroes who purge the whole continent from the aggression of those cruel creatures.\n\nStand strong and brave, comrades! We will prevail!"

stalliongrad.133.t:0 "Sinister speaks against Equestrian aggression"
stalliongrad.133.d:0 "Comrades! I want to announce the news as exciting as the great ones. Our righteous socialist country was attacked, and by these actions Equestria finally showed its true face - the disgusting face of the reactionary plutocracy.\n\nA great people such as the Stalliongradians cannot remain in suspense and we are proud to participate in this gigantic struggle which is destined to transform the world geographically, politically and spiritually. Truly, there is taking place today a formidable struggle between two worlds. Never has the history seen a similar drama, a drama in which we are now among the great leading characters.\n\nThe task of the hour is one and only one: To fight, to fight all together. The comradeship between us becomes closer day by day, becomes a way of common life. We are similar enough and different enough to understand each other, to esteem each other mutually, to fuse together all our energies, since the cause is one. No longer can distinctions be made; our enemies do not make any.\n\nThe Equestrian plutocracy are conducting this war with one sole purpose: They want to reduce the globe to the state in which Buffalo State is today. They want all of people to work in order to give the Equestrian Bourgeoisie an another millennium of another name of exploitation - a "Harmony". They want a world of slaves in order to guarantee for the Сanterlot aristocracy their five daily digestions. They want to destroy Communism, and under this name they include all the movements such as include Starlight ideology that named as Equality...\n\nNow, comrades, we must fight for the living ones, fight for the future, but also for the dead. We must fight so that the sacrifice of our dead be not in vain, so that the sacrifice of those who fell in the revolutionary war.\n\nThey, the dead, imperiously command us to fight through till victory. We obey."

stalliongrad.134.d:0 "Comrades! Heroes of the revolution! Stallions and Fillies of Stalliongrad! An hour appointed by destiny has struck in the heavens of our Motherland.\n\nThe declaration of war has already been delivered to the ambassadors of Equestria. We go to battle against the plutocratic and reactionary "Harmony" of fake goddesses who, at every moment have hindered the advance and have often endangered the very existence of the Stalliongradian people.\n\nRecent historical events can be summarised in the following phrases: promises, threats, blackmail and sabotage. With you the entire world is witness that Communist Stalliongrad has done all that is possible to avoid the torment which is throwing our continent into turmoil; but all was in vain. It would have sufficed to revise the treaties to bring them up to date with the changing needs of the life of our nation and not consider them untouchable for eternity.\n\nBut now all of that belongs to the past. If now today we have decided to face the risks and the sacrifices of a war, it is because the honour, the interests, the future impose an iron necessity, since a great people is truly such if it considers sacred its own duties and not evade the supreme trials which change the course of history.\n\nWe take rifles in hooves to free the working people of all Equestria from exploitation and plutocracy, which in the minds of the masses is indestructible and endless.\n\nThis gigantic struggle is nothing other than a phase in the logical development of our revolution; it is the struggle of peoples that are poor but rich in workers against the exploiters who hold on ferociously to the monopoly off all the riches and all the gold of the world; it is the struggle between our century and two ideas.\n\nProletarian Stalliongrad stands up again, strong, proud, and united as never before. The single order of the day is categorical and obligatory for all. And this order is... Victory! And we will win, in order finally to give a long period of peace with justice to Stalliongrad, to Equestria, and to the world.\n\nComrades!\nThis is a war to end all wars!"

It is a duty to protect all the working people from oppression and violence. The time has come to fulfil our promises.\n\nPeople of [From.GetNameDef] will be glad to get rid of the chains of capital with the help of our brave people's army, and then replenish the ranks of fighters with the bourgeoisie of the whole world.\n\nLong live Stalliongrad!

The troops of the Winghagen Order are attacking the eastern frontiers of Severyana Principality. They capture Zvezdopadovo, torture and kill local ponies. Knights start planning how to divide the Severyana lands, appropriating titles of princes and hoping for the support of the Archon of Griffenheim. In an assembly Severyana ponies decide to organize an army and call an experienced commander Prince Alexander, nicknamed Snezhensky. Two heroes - Gavrila Sich and Vaska Buslaev - get married to one girl, and she decides that she will choose the one who will better show himself in a battle.\n\nThe troops converge to the shores of the frozen river Morozova. Before the battle, one warrior tells the prince a fable about a fox stuck in a fork of a tree, where a hare lured her. Alexander acts in a similar manner: he arranges his troops in V-shaped formation, while the “wild boar” of the Winghagens comes right in the center. Severyans surround the enemy and break it. The griffons, who try to flee, break through the ice in their heavy armour and drown. The leaders of the aggressors are captured..."

The key fits in the door of the apartment with the same number. Inside, even the furniture is nearly identical to that of Zhenya's apartment. Zhenya is too drunk to notice any minor differences, and goes to sleep.\n\nLater, the real tenant, Nadya Sennova, arrives home to find a strange pony sleeping in her bed. To make matters worse, Nadya’s fiancé, Ipponit, arrives before Nadya can convince Zhenya to get up and leave..."
